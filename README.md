# UFO Sightings Webpage

# Overview

We created a webpage using HTML to display our UFO sightings article and a dynamic search table. We used JavaScript to build the dynamic search table, creating filters to search and manipulate the table. 

## Process:
### Set-Up for Deliverable 1:
1. We used HTML to build a webpage to display UFO sightings data
2. We used JavaScript to build a dynamic table with search functions
3. We used CSS file to add a background image and color

### Deliverable 1: Filter UFO sightings on multiple search criteria
* Using JavaScript, we added dynamic search functions to filter the table for city, state, country and shape
* We created functions that will filter the table data by the value entered in the search boxes
* We used our HTML file to style the filter table and make it more visually appealing

## Resources:
Data Sources: [UFO Sightings Data](https://github.com/corispade/UFO_Sightings/blob/main/static/js/data.js)

Versions: Python 3.7.6, HTML5/CSS, Bootstrap 5.1.0

Environment: Visual Studio Code

* Press enter

After Search:

In order to refresh the search table, scroll to the top of the page and click "UFO Sightings" to refresh:


# Summary:
One major drawback of this website is that the search table only shows static data from the past. I would create a separate webpage where people can input their own UFO sightings, then I could set up my webpage to pull the new data in order to keep my website up to date and relevant. 

Recommendations I have for further development:

1. Move the refresh button to set it below the search table. It is difficult to find and a bit annoying to scroll to the top of the page just to refresh the table.

2. The only country in the data provided is the US. Either find more data from outside the US, or remove the country filter as it is an unnecessary addition.
